## A Blank Drupal template made with Foundation Zurb

------
##By Developer to Developers
I wrote this blank template for projects first, then I wanted to share it with You.

##Why do You use Foundation 3.2.5?
I'm Italian, and I develop websites firstly for the Italian market.
Just because in Italy, the 25% of visitors still uses IE8, I must think to them too. 

##Hey! This theme is so poor of functionalities and completely white! It's horrible!
I know and wrote it above! 
I wrote this theme as a Starter Theme, just to have a responsive drupal website ready to work with Foundation Zurb. 
Customize it and develop it it's up to You. At the end, You are a developer, it's Your job! :)

------
I used the compass version of Foundation Zurb, if You don't know how to use it read the documentation [here](http://foundation.zurb.com/old-docs/f3/compass.php) 

Feel free to contribute, and to submit bugs or better implementations of the code. Enjoy!
